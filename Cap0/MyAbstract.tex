\textbf{Abstract ---} 
\sloppy
 The robotic grasping persists as a problem in the modern industry that seeks autonomous, fast implementation, and efficient techniques in complex scenarios. The deployment of a modular and reconfigurable grasping framework for robots attending real demands is modest, even with several methodologies proposals. Scientifically, the robot community lacks in a well structured and formalized grasping pipeline architecture that organizes approaches allowing the evaluation and the base to new advancements. By offering this novel grasping pipeline, endowed with proper user interface and embedded methodologies, the scientific community will have at his disposal a base software structure for easy integration and testing of new scientific contributions. The industry will have an intuitive and powerful tool capable of solving the grasping problem in several scenarios.
 
\textbf{Key Words:} Modular Software Architecture, Grasping Planning; Robotic Manipulation.
