\chapter{Technical and Theoretical Background}
\label{cap2a:background}

Some background concepts used in the current thesis proposal are discussed in this chapter. Namely, Section~\ref{sec:grippers_technolgy} is focused on explaining the existing gripper technology and how devices and robots can grasp. Since a wide number of applications use multi-finger grasping, the theoretical background of this theme is presented in Section~\ref{sec:multifingered_grasping}. In the end, Section~\ref{sec:sim_ann} addresses the optimisation algorithm method embedded into the ``GraspIt!" simulator which is widely used by the academic community and deployed in the current thesis proposal.
